This is a copy of the well-known MNIST database of handwritten digits,
available from http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

The MNIST database of handwritten digits consists of a training set of
60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples. It is a subset of
a larger set available from NIST. The digits have been size-normalized
and centered in a fixed-size image.

The original black and white (bilevel) images from NIST were size
normalized to fit in a 20x20 pixel box while preserving their aspect
ratio. The resulting images contain grey levels as a result of the
anti-aliasing technique used by the normalization algorithm. the
images were centered in a 28x28 image by computing the center of mass
of the pixels, and translating the image so as to position this point
at the center of the 28x28 field.
