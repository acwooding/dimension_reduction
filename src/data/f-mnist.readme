This is a copy of Zalando's Fashion-MNIST [F-MNIST] dataset:
https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist

Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article imagesâ€”consisting of a
training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000
examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a
label from 10 classes. Fashion-MNIST is intended to serve as a direct
drop-in replacement for the original MNIST dataset for benchmarking
machine learning algorithms. It shares the same image size and
structure of training and testing splits.
