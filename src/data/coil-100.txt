Columbia Object Image Library (COIL-100) is a database of color images of 100 objects.

This dataset consists of 7,200 color images of 100 objects (72 images per object) where the objects
have been placed on a motorized turntable against a black background. Images were taken at 5 degree rotations,
giving 72 images per object. The resulting images were then size and intensity-normalized.

Size normalization involved first clipping to a rectangual bounding box and resized (with aspect
ratio preserved) to 128x128 using interpolation-decimation filters to minimize aliasing [Oppenheim and Schafer-1989].

To normalize intensity, every image was histogram stretched, i.e. the intensity
of the brightest pixel was made 65535 and intensities of the other pixels were scaled accordingly.
The images were saved as 16-bit PPM (portable pixmap) color images.

Raw data files are named according to object and rotation; e.g.  `obj7__10.ppm`.
The prefix "obj7" identifies the object, and "10" indicates the rotation in degrees.

A greyscale version of this dataset is also available (COIL-20)
